        Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
        start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
        overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress,
        those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet.
        On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza
        was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost
        100 pounds and completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on
        different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.
